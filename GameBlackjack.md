# Instructions #
To play a game, at least one human player needs to join.  When this player joins, they are required to place the minimum bet before the option to deal is provided.

Once the player deals they are able to hit, stand, double, or split as determined by the specific state of the game.

After all of the players have taken their turn, the house needs to take their turn.  This is accomplished by executing the "Next" action.  This will turn the house's face down card to be face up and will cause the house to take the required number of hits.  A successive "Next" action will award the winnings or take away chips based on the outcome of the game.  A final "Next" action will clear the game board, returning all of the cards to the deck and moving a players winnings back into their deck.

After the board has been cleared players are allowed to place a new bet and game play continues.

# Rules #

Assume the standard rules of Blackjack with the following clarifications:
**A player can split only once** A player is not allowed to double on a hand that was split
**When a player doubles, they are required to fully double their bet**

## Betting ##
A player has two areas on the game board for chips, the first of these areas is the one that the initial bet is required to be placed in.  This is the proper place for chips to be placed and placing them in the other pile will not indicate to the game that the player has placed the minimum bet.

## Splitting ##
When a player splits, their cards are moved from their hand to the table.  The betting proceeds one hand after another.  Once the player has stood or busted on their first hand, the actions automatically are applied to the second hand.
