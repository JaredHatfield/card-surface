The goal is to create an interactive touch based version of Blackjack that utilizes wireless mobile devices to display the user's face down card.  Any number of wireless devices could be used including: iPhone, iPod Touch, Droid, Palm Pre, BlackBerry, Zune HD, and other browser enabled portable devices.  The system should be able to support 7 players at a time.  Users will be able to log into the system with a username and password.  A user's account will include a profile picture, their account balance, and some statistics about their game play history.  A user will be able to manage their account from their mobile device.  When playing a game, the interaction with the interface should be natural and mimic real life game play per technical limitations of the display interface.   Betting will be conducted in accordance with the standard game rules including a minimum bet and an optional maximum bet.
