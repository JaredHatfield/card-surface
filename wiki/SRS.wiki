=2. General Description=
The goal is to create an interactive touch based version of Blackjack that utilizes wireless mobile devices to display the user's face down card.  Any number of wireless devices could be used including: iPhone, iPod Touch, Droid, Palm Pre, BlackBerry, Zune HD, and other browser enabled portable devices.
